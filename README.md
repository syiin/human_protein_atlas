# Human Protein Atlas

Managed to finish in the Top 12%

The various iterations and notes along my way to create a convolutional neural network that to recognise proteins inside microscopy staining images.  

I use the FastAI library to get started quickly as well as the pretrained models: https://github.com/Cadene/pretrained-models.pytorch

WARNING: this is obviously not very tidy code but I completed this project in spare time in the evenings
